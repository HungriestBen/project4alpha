INTRODUCTION
------------
Is a multiplayer game in it's alpha stage

Inspired by popular TV show Squid Game, El'Squido draws from the first game of the series; Red Light Green Light.


OBJECTIVE
---------
The objective is to move your character to the other side of the room alive using the < and > arrow keys.
The challenge is that the ball on the other side will change colours from green to red and whilst red, if you move you will die.

There is no true winner, just that you live another day.

TECHNOLOGIES
------------
Game was built using HTML/CSS and Javascript and multiplayer aspect uses websockets from my express server.

UPCOMING CHANGES
---------
Will implement into a react app, with a host/join game option and name input landing page.
Will introduce 2 new games down the line - Tug o War and remaining alive players will enter a FFA Knife fight.
Tug of War will use similar game mechanics as Red Light Green Light but teams will be split into 2 arrays and whoevers team hits a certain position, they will win/lose.

Knife game will need to add collision detection and change movement from keyup to keydown, adding a keyup attack button and add a health progress bar.

Make the CSS better, design something better than a circle for characters whilst still knowing your character - maybe sticking to character colours.
